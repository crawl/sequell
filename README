Henzell
-------

Henzell is the announcement and stats IRC bot for ##crawl on Freenode IRC.


Dependencies
------------

Henzell wants a slew of Perl modules for IRC, YAML parsing, DB
connectivity, etc.; it will usually produce a somewhat relevant error
message when it cannot find a module it wants.

If you want to use Henzell with a non-DGL crawl, build it with at
least these flags:

    make EXTERNAL_DEFINES="-DDGL_MILESTONES -DDGL_WHEREIS -DDGL_EXTENDED_LOGFILES"


Configuring Henzell
-------------------

Henzell can do several things based on how it's configured:

1. Make Crawl game announcements based on events in any number of
   Crawl logfiles and milestones files (if announce=1 and
   announce_channel is not empty).

2. Store new game events from any number of logfiles and milestone
   files into a PostgreSQL database (if sql_store=1).

3. Answer queries for games and milestones (if sql_queries=1).

You configure Henzell by supplying a henzell.rc in the *directory from
which you run Henzell*. You can alternatively specify the rc filename
as a command-line option with:

perl henzell.pl --rc=some/path/to/myweirdrc

Some sample henzell rc files are included in this repository
(henzell.rc.cao, henzell.rc.sequell, henzell.rc.ircnet).


Henzell for announcements
-------------------------

If you're running a Crawl server and want Henzell to make
announcements, edit def.logs and def.stones and add entries for your
Crawl logfiles and milestone files. Enable announcements (announce=1
and announce_channel=##crawl) in your henzell.rc.

Also choose a unique abbreviation for your server. For instance,
crawl.akrasiac.org is abbreviated as cao, and this must be set both in
henzell.rc and in def.logs/def.stones to identify local logs:

In def.logs:

[local:cao]
/home/crawl/chroot/var/games/crawl04/saves/logfile

In henzell.rc:

bot_nick = NotTheRealHenzell
host = cao
announce = 1
announce_channel = ##crawl

This unique abbreviation is quite important if you're using sql_store=1.


Henzell for SQL queries
-----------------------

This is more complicated than a simple announcement bot:

1. Install PostgreSQL, create a database 'henzell' and a user 'henzell', and
   give the user access to the database with password 'henzell'.

2. In the 'henzell' database, install the PostgreSQL citext and orafce
   extensions by running (as an admin user):
      CREATE EXTENSION citext;
      CREATE EXTENSION orafce;

   citext is available as part of Postgres contrib; orafce is available at:
      http://orafce.projects.postgresql.org/

   Henzell needs the CITEXT extension for case-insensitive comparison
   and grouping and the orafce extension for the median aggregate function.

2. Set up the database schema with:

   psql -U henzell henzell < henzell.sql

3. Make sure def.logs and def.stones are set up correctly.

4. Run Henzell with an rc that includes:

   sql_store = 1
   sql_queries = 1
   commands_file = commands/commands-sequell.txt

If you want the bot to do both announcements and SQL queries, you must
merge the commands files into one big list of commands.
